## **v1.2a**

TicTacToe Project by Lachlan Mackenzie

The base of this project is based on a tutorial by Youtuber PortExe (https://youtu.be/yaPUl31nypk).

## Features added by me:
### v1.2a
- Removed an unused function and other bloat in main.js

### v1.2
- Fixed responsive layout for phone screens
- Changed behaviour of grid colour change when tapping the screen (brief colour flash)
- Redone ai behaviour to check for partially completed combos by the player and then chose an empty square at random from that combo. Has resulted in a higher chance of the ai to block you and even win if your not careful
- Fixed a logic flaw when checking for a victory or draw when all spaces filled

### v1.1
- Added menu
- Added score counters and button to reset scores in menu
- Added draw checks
- Added ability to update the player name in the menu

### v1.0
- Added checks to stop player from choosing a square that is already taken
