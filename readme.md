<h3>v1.2</h3>

<p>TicTacToe Project by Lachlan Mackenzie</p>

<p>The base of this project is based on a tutorial by Youtuber PortExe (https://youtu.be/yaPUl31nypk).</p>

<p>Features added by me:</p>
<ul>
<h4>v1.2</h4>
<li>Fixed responsive layout for phone screens</li>
<li>Changed behaviour of grid colour change when tapping the screen (brief colour flash)</li>
<li>Redone ai behaviour to check for partially completed combos by the player and then chose an empty square at random from that combo. Has resulted in a higher chance of the ai to block you and even win if your not careful</li>
<li>Fixed a logic flaw when checking for a victory or draw when all spaces filled</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h4>v1.1:</h4>
<li>Added menu</li>
<li>Added score counters and button to reset scores in menu</li>
<li>Added draw checks</li>
<li>Added ability to update the player name in the menu</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h4>v1.0:</h4>

</ul>

<ul>
<h4>To-Do list:</h4>
